### Contributing

If you are looking to contribute to the project, you are **strongly encouraged** to open a [**GitHub issue**](https://github.com/react-chatbotify/discord-bot/issues) describing what you intend to do (e.g. fix a bug). The **exception** to this is if you're only making **very minor changes such as typos**. If in doubt, it doesn't hurt to just create an issue.

Depending on the scale of your intended changes (e.g. add new feature), you may find the [**Developer Guide**](https://github.com/react-chatbotify/discord-bot/blob/main/docs/DeveloperGuide.md) useful for understanding the structure and design considerations for the project. You may also reach out on [**discord**](https://discord.gg/6R4DK4G5Zh) for clarifications. As a general rule of thumb, if you are **touching the codebase directly**, do give the developer guide a read.

For this project, the [**forking workflow**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) is encouraged and you may open a pull request with clear descriptions on the changes and what they are intended to do (enhancement, bug fixes etc). Alternatively, you may simply report bugs or raise suggestions by opening an [**issue**](https://github.com/react-chatbotify/discord-bot/issues) or submitting it on [**discord**](https://discord.gg/6R4DK4G5Zh).

Note: Templates have been created for pull requests and issues to guide you in the process.
